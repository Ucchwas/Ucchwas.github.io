A selection of my key projects:

## Smart Health App  
**Tools:** Java, Android Studio  
**Repo:** [Smart‑Health‑Application‑V4](https://github.com/cpslabttu/Smart-Health-Application-V4)  
- Developed a mobile app to visualize real‑time ECG and respiratory signals, providing users with instant insights into vital signs while detecting cardiac irregularities and respiratory patterns.  
- Implemented algorithms to calculate heart and respiration rates and optimized the app for mobile devices to ensure smooth performance and reliable monitoring.

## CardioHelp Visualizer  
**Tools:** Node.js, JavaScript, MongoDB, GeoJSON  
**Repo:** [CardioHelp‑Visualizer](https://github.com/Ucchwas/CardioHelp-Visualizer)  
- Visualizes the geographic distribution of cardiac patients using interactive maps, enabling users to explore real‑time patient data, regional trends, and demographic patterns in cardiovascular health.  
- Delivers personalized health guidance and educational resources, allowing users to gain actionable insights into their own risk factors while promoting greater awareness of heart health.

## ECG Classification using Deep Learning  
**Tools:** Python, Google Colab, TensorFlow  
**Repo:** [ECG‑Classification‑using‑ML‑models](https://github.com/Ucchwas/ECG-Classification-using-ML-models)  
- Built ML models to classify different cardiac beats using the MIT‑BIH Arrhythmia database.  
- Introduced Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic samples for rare beat types, boosting model accuracy.

## Silent Speech Recognition Using LLM  
**Tools:** Python, PyTorch, LLAMA 3.2B  
**Repo:** [Silent‑Speech](https://github.com/Ucchwas/Silent-Speech)  
- Developed an EMG adapter module that transforms unvoiced EMG signals into embeddings interpretable by LLAMA 3.2B, enabling context‑aware, zero‑audio speech decoding on a closed‑vocabulary task.  
- Built robust preprocessing and fine‑tuning pipelines to seamlessly integrate EMG features with the LLM, demonstrating silent‑speech decoding with minimal training data.

## AI‑Driven Defense Against Boundary Attacks  
**Tools:** Python, PyTorch, Foolbox  
**Repo:** [AI‑Driven‑Defense‑Against‑Boundary‑Attacks](https://github.com/Ucchwas/AI-Driven-Defense-Against-Boundary-Attacks)  
- Combined adversarial training with boundary‐based detection to protect classifiers from black‑box boundary attacks while preserving high performance.  
- Designed automated Foolbox evaluation workflows to systematically stress‑test model resilience and trigger defenses on suspicious inputs.

## On‑Demand Professor Q&A Bot  
**Tools:** Python, OpenAI, Chainlit, Chroma DB  
**Repo:** [OnDemand‑Professor‑Q‑A‑Bot](https://github.com/Ucchwas/OnDemand-Professor-Q-A-Bot)  
- Built a Q&A assistant leveraging vector‑based retrieval over lecture materials to help professors find slides and notes instantly.  
- Integrated GPT‑3.5 Turbo for real‑time interactions and used PDF loaders to index course materials.

## Apnea‑Non‑Apnea Analysis  
**Tools:** Python, TensorFlow, Google Colab  
**Repo:** [Apnea‑ECG](https://github.com/Ucchwas/Apnea-ECG)  
- Developed ML pipelines to detect sleep apnea events from respiratory signals in the Apnea‑ECG database.  
- Extracted time‑ and frequency‑domain features to improve classification performance.

## Sleep Stage Detection Using Polysomnographic Data  
**Tools:** Python, Google Colab  
**Repo:** [Sleep-Stage-Detection](https://github.com/Ucchwas/Polysomnographic-Database-Respiration-and-ECG-features)  
- Analyzed combined ECG and respiration belt data from the MIT‑BIH Polysomnographic database.  
- Identified breathing patterns and cardiac events to classify sleep stages for sleep disorder research.

## Adversarial Machine Learning  
**Tools:** Python, PyTorch, Jupyter Notebook  
**Repo:** [Adversarial‑Machine‑Learning](https://github.com/Ucchwas/Adversarial-Machine-Learning)  
- Implemented untargeted and targeted attacks (FGSM, PGD, C&W) and defenses such as adversarial training.  
- Conducted experiments on image classification models to measure and improve robustness.

## Compiler Design  
**Tools:** C, C++, Flex, Bison  
**Repo:** [Compiler‑Offlines](https://github.com/Ucchwas/Compiler-Offlines)  
- Built lexical analyzers, parsers, and syntax checkers as part of multiple compiler‐design assignments.

## Room Renting Platform  
**Tools:** PHP, Laravel  
**Repo:** [Room_Renting](https://github.com/Ucchwas/Room_Renting)  
- Created a web‑based booking platform where clients can search and reserve rooms, and owners can list properties and manage bookings.
