## Biography

I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at Texas Tech University, with a specialization in real-time healthcare applications. My research pushes the boundaries of embedded IoT, cyber-physical systems, and edge-AI, delivering ultra-low-power sensor designs and cutting-edge deep learning solutions, including Large Language Models (LLMs) for physiological signal prediction. These innovations fuel next-generation wearable and mobile health technologies, enhancing clinical decision-making and personalized care.

In parallel, I bring hands-on industry experience as a full stack developer and software engineer. Iâ€™ve built and deployed robust software systems used by thousands, with expertise in architecting scalable REST APIs, maintaining production-grade backends, and designing intuitive web and mobile interfaces. My work also includes deploying secure, privacy-preserving data pipelines and AI models on edge devices, blending advanced research with practical engineering.

I am motivated to collaborate with dynamic, innovative teams, utilizing my expertise in system design, AI optimization, and scalable, user-focused solutions. I look forward to joining forward-thinking organizations, applying the transformative power of AI and LLMs to develop intelligent, impactful technologies that shape the future.
