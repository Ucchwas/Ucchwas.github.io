I’m building ultra‑low‑power, inkjet‑printed wearable sensors and edge‑AI pipelines for **real‑time health monitoring**—focusing on:

1. **ECG & Respiratory Analysis**  
   On‑device algorithms for beat detection and respiration monitoring with flexible electrodes.

2. **Adversarial‑Robust AI**  
   Defenses to ensure reliable health analytics in adversarial environments.

3. **Wearable IoT Systems**  
   End‑to‑end sensor hardware, firmware, and cloud integration for continuous patient monitoring.
